        "marker":"‘Is this because the room on the fourth floor is too small,’ Margaret Flinders asks herself, as she walks home from Mr. Papenmeyer’s market, ‘because Charles Street is too narrow?’() In The Unpossessed, she and her husband, Mr. Miles Flinders, live at Number 60, Charles Street, a place, the narrator states in the last chapter, that they have rented in order to 'hide from life' (). The novel comes to an alarming head here in the last chapter, in which Margaret has just had an abortion in order to 'free' her husband. As the car takes them from the Greenway Maternity Home down the length of Manhattan and across 14th Street, Mrs. Flinders muses that just as Miles now seems to be 'bobbing like an empty ghost' (), the apartment on Charles Street would be now 'empty and dead'(). There is a sense here of nothing in their lives changing, though the life of the city moves on rapidly without them. There is a sense also, especially when compared to the description of the surrounding neighborhood in the first chapter, of the static, unchanging nature of the Village. When we are given the 'tour of the city' through the car ride from the hospital, we see that elsewhere in Manhattan, there are people 'not afraid to perpetuate themselves'(). Not afraid to have babies, of course, is Slesinger’s literal meaning. Unlike the little group and their fantasy of the magazine that never comes to be, perhaps it is also, that elsewhere, they are not afraid to perpetuate their ideas, in the outside world. Not afraid, perhaps, to take action.It is curious, also, to note that for a period, Slesinger lived on Charles Street with her then husband, Herbert Solow. However, perhaps what Slesinger is saying is that Greenwich Village is to the Intellectuals and other cultural groups, what the apartment on Charles Street is to the Flinders: a place of voluntary isolation… a place to hide from life.",

        "marker":"Perhaps one of the most iconic sites for the cultural movements of the past, Washington Square began as a burial ground for the city's poor and criminal. The park was built in 1826, but remnants of its shadowy history can be seen to this day. One such piece of the past, the city's oldest living tree known as the Hangman's Elm, looms over the Northeast Corner of the park. As its name suggests, this tree is said to be the site where the city's condemned were executed by hanging. For many decades, the square was an alcove amidst the city’s finer, richer neighborhoods. Then, in 1917, a group of artists and friends that included painters, John Sloan and Marcel Duchamps, climbed to the top of the Washington Square Arch to proclaim succession from the United States and declare Greenwich Village an “independent republic”. Although mentioned only briefly in the opening chapters of The Unpossessed (),  through Tess Slesinger’s days and many decades after, the square became a repository for the otherwise “taboo”, the heart of a neighborhood known as a hub for the city’s (and the nation’s) cultural movements.  <img src='images/1935wsp.jpg' id= 'wsp-image'>",

On the way, she passes through Sheridan Square, where she muses that 'Soon the last leaf would be off the last tree'. This is the first mention of the little public garden at the intersection of West 4th Street and Washington Place. In 1938, this location would see the opening of the first racially integrated nightclub in New York City, a basement lounge called Cafe Society. However, in 1936, when Tess Slesinger published The Unpossessed, the square would have served as little more than a traffic-safety island. Living in a city wherein, even in the 1930s, nature was very much a thing of the past, Mrs. Flinders viewed the rare glimpse of leaves falling in the little park as an indication of the transition between seasons. 'Soon...,' writes Slesinger, 'there would be that feeling in one's chest of ending and beginning again, expelling the last of one breath and expanding the lungs for the intake of another; sorrow for the departed year curling smaller and smaller until it was dead...'",

However, for Margaret Flinders, one of Slesinger’s main characters, it represents nothing. Time is clearly passing, Margaret muses. Seasons are changing, but, as the grocer, Mr. Papenmeyer, explains, with each cycle of seasons all that’s left to do is say, “here’s another winter with everything to do again” (). In other words, though the clock ticks, nothing happens. Last year, the Flinder were on Tenth Street; this year, they are on Charles. It is a move, but only a move of a few blocks.",

The cafe was opened in 1927 and has since changed very little. This is part of the charm, according to current owners, the Cavallacci family. In an article by the New York Business Journal in 2015, manager Lena Batyuk stated that there were no plans to change anything in the foreseeable future. “Everything in New York changes,” she told the Journal, “but we don’t. That’s the beauty of it.” ",
