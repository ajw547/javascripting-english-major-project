Welcome to [Greenwich Village](http://greenwichvillage.nyc) in the 1930s, where the monthly rent of an apartment averages around $40, where you can find tenements and rooming houses within blocks of the some of the city's most expensive hotels and houses. Here, art and culture flourishes. Among the urban thoroughfares sits a quaint, relaxed oasis that will become the stomping grounds of some of the country's most mythologized figures.

It is here, on Charles Street, where Tess Slesinger places two of her main characters, Margaret and Miles Flinders. It is also here where Slesinger spent much of the '30s.
