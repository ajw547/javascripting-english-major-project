Welcome to [Greenwich Village](http://greenwichvillage.nyc) in the 1930s, where the monthly rent of an apartment averages around $40, where you can find tenements and rooming houses within blocks of the some of the city's most expensive hotels and houses. Here, art and culture flourishes. Among the urban thoroughfares sits a quaint, relaxed oasis that will become the stomping grounds of some of the country's most mythologized figures.

It is here, on Charles Street, where Tess Slesinger places two of her main characters, Margaret and Miles Flinders. It is also here where Slesinger spent much of the '30s.

The daughter of Hungarian-Russian Jewish immigrants, Slesinger grew up in New York City’s Upper West Side during the first couple decades of the 20th century. She attended the Ethical Culture Society School and then later went on to Swarthmore College, and then to Columbia School of Journalism, where she received a B.A. in English in 1925. It was there that she met Herbert Solow, who she went on to marry in 1928. Solow, along with Columbia professor Elliot Cohen, became founders and editors of left-wing cultural magazine, the Menorah Journal. While writing book reviews for the Journal, Slesinger moved in this circle of Intellectuals. (more)

Slesinger’s first publication came in 1932, the year she and Solow divorced, and was printed in Story magazine . It was a short story titled Missis Flinders’, a raw tale of a young woman’s decision to have an abortion at the behest of her husband. Later, this piece of short fiction would become the last chapter in her successful 1934 novel, The Unpossessed. This novel, a portrait of a generation with ideals larger than themselves, was largely based on Slesinger’s own experiences within the intellectual circle and was dedicated, perhaps a bit sourly, “to my contemporaries”.
