## Greenwich Village

Welcome to [Greenwich Village](http://greenwichvillage.nyc) in the 1930s, where the monthly rent of an apartment averages around $40, where you can find tenements and rooming houses within blocks of the some of the city's most expensive hotels and houses. Here, art and culture flourishes. Among the urban thoroughfares sits a quaint, relaxed oasis that will become the stomping grounds of some of the country's most mythologized figures. Here you can read about such places as Charles Street and Washington Square Park.
