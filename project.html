    <p1> If New York City is “a nest of enclaves in the surrounding smother” (Slesinger, vii) as Hardwick writes, Greenwich Village is home to some of the most isolated of these enclaves. Originally a little country hamlet, long before the city had expanded its reaches upward, the Village was spared from the grid pattern of the rest of Manhattan. The twisting, somewhat confusing 18th century street pattern is at once peaceful and disorienting. It is utterly unintuitive, for example, to someone used to the usual grid, that West 4th Street and West 12th Streets intersect, when it seems that they ought to be parallel instead.
    Perhaps it is because of this unfamiliarity and seclusion that many of the city’s cultural movements began here. Is it just, as some might say, the magic of the Village? Or does the geography simply lend itself to the cultivation of ideas?

    Maybe. Another question we might ask, and it is one that Tess Slesinger asked as well, is that even if it does lend itself to these intellectual and creative emergences, is it a neighborhood that aids in the spreading of these ideas? Or does it, in fact, hinder them?

    As she writes in the opening chapter of her novel, ‘[is] there progress? [is] there change?’ (9)</p>
