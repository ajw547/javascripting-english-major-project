## Tenth Street

In the opening chapter of The Unpossessed, the narrator remarks that the Flinders live ''This year on Charles Street. Last year on Tenth; surely these were stations along some route?''() Outwardly, a move such as this should represent some change in a person’s life. However, for Margaret Flinders, one of Slesinger’s main characters, it represents nothing. Time is clearly passing, Margaret muses. Seasons are changing, but, as the grocer, Mr. Papenmeyer, explains, with each cycle of seasons all that’s left to do is say, ''here’s another winter with everything to do again'' (). In other words, though the clock ticks, nothing happens. Last year, the Flinder were on Tenth Street; this year, they are on Charles. It is a move, but only a move of a few blocks.
